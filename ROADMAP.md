# Roadmap

This is direction, not a promise or release calendar. Concrete work is tracked
in [Issues](https://github.com/cristicretu/diri/issues).

## Now

- Keep `main` green and protected by required CI checks.
- Make session persistence and daemon upgrades boring and recoverable.
- Expand first-class agent manifests and status-detection coverage.
- Improve contributor docs, security reporting, privacy disclosure, and release
  supply-chain checks.

## Next

- Bring the Rust engine to feature parity with the shipped Swift daemon.
- Improve remote-node setup, diagnostics, and least-privilege guidance.
- Add deeper end-to-end tests for app updates and session recovery.
- Move more release provenance into reproducible, attestable CI steps while
  preserving Apple signing and notarization requirements.

## Distribution

- Continue publishing signed, notarized releases and the maintained Homebrew
  tap.
- Submit Diri to the official Homebrew cask repository once it is eligible.
  The owner-submission notability threshold is met; the remaining normal policy
  gate opens on September 3, 2026, when the repository is 30 days old. The
  [submission runbook](docs/HOMEBREW_CASK_SUBMISSION.md) keeps the candidate,
  checksum verification, and validation commands ready. Until acceptance, the
  supported command is `brew install --cask cristicretu/diri/diri`.

## Not planned

- A hosted Diri account or telemetry service.
- Treating agent processes as a security sandbox. Diri orchestrates trusted
  developer tools; it does not contain them.
