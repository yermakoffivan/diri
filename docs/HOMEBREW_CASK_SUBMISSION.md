# Official Homebrew cask submission

Diri is currently installed from the maintained
[`cristicretu/homebrew-diri`](https://github.com/cristicretu/homebrew-diri)
tap. This runbook records the remaining eligibility gate and the exact process
for moving the proven cask to
[`Homebrew/homebrew-cask`](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-cask) without
changing the artifact users receive.

## Eligibility snapshot

Checked on August 11, 2026:

- The canonical repository was created on August 4, 2026 at 10:08 UTC.
- The repository has 248 stars, above Homebrew's 225-star threshold for a
  self-submission by the repository owner.
- Homebrew says a repository less than 30 days old is normally ineligible. The
  remaining normal gate therefore opens on **September 3, 2026 at 10:08 UTC**.

Do not submit before that date merely because the notability threshold is met.
On the submission day, re-read Homebrew's current
[Package Acceptance Policy](https://docs.brew.sh/Package-Acceptance-Policy) and
[Acceptable Casks](https://docs.brew.sh/Acceptable-Casks); the policy, commands,
and thresholds can change.

Recheck the live repository values rather than relying on this snapshot:

```sh
gh repo view cristicretu/diri --json createdAt,stargazerCount
```

## Source of truth

Do not hand-reconstruct the official cask. Start from
[`Casks/diri.rb`](https://github.com/cristicretu/homebrew-diri/blob/main/Casks/diri.rb)
in the maintained tap. Every Diri release updates that cask only after
`diri/scripts/publish-homebrew-cask.sh` proves that its SHA-256 matches the
immutable GitHub Release DMG and reads the pushed cask back from the remote.

Before copying it, verify the current release and digest again:

```sh
version="$(gh release view --repo cristicretu/diri --json tagName --jq '.tagName | ltrimstr("v")')"
gh release view "v${version}" --repo cristicretu/diri \
  --json assets \
  --jq ".assets[] | select(.name == \"diri-${version}-universal.dmg\") | .digest"
gh api repos/cristicretu/homebrew-diri/contents/Casks/diri.rb \
  --jq '.content' | base64 --decode
```

The release digest must be `sha256:<64 lowercase hexadecimal digits>`, and the
same 64 digits must appear in the cask's `sha256` stanza. The URL must continue
to name the versioned GitHub Release DMG.

## Prepare the Homebrew contribution

Follow Homebrew's current
[adding-software guide](https://docs.brew.sh/Adding-Software-to-Homebrew) to fork
and check out `Homebrew/homebrew-cask` from its latest default branch. Search
open and closed pull requests for an existing `diri` submission before creating
another one.

Copy the maintained cask into Homebrew's token directory:

```sh
cp /path/to/homebrew-diri/Casks/diri.rb \
  /path/to/homebrew-cask/Casks/d/diri.rb
```

Review the copied file against the current Cask Cookbook. In particular, keep:

- the versioned, developer-published GitHub Release URL and exact checksum;
- `depends_on macos: :sequoia`, matching Diri's macOS 15 deployment target;
- `auto_updates true`, because Diri has a signed, user-approved in-app updater;
- the conservative `zap` list, which deliberately preserves daemon session
  state under `~/Library/Application Support/Dirijor`.

## Validate the candidate

Run Homebrew's current new-cask checks from the contribution checkout:

```sh
brew style --fix --cask Casks/d/diri.rb
brew audit --new --cask Casks/d/diri.rb --online
HOMEBREW_NO_INSTALL_FROM_API=1 brew install --cask Casks/d/diri.rb
brew uninstall --cask diri
brew lgtm --online
```

Inspect the installed application as well as the exit codes. Confirm that it is
the universal, signed, notarized `diri.app`, launches on a clean current macOS
system, and uninstalls without deleting existing Dirijor session state.

Open the upstream pull request with concise test results and no generated or
unrelated files. Meeting the published thresholds does not guarantee acceptance;
respond to Homebrew maintainer feedback in the upstream pull request.

## After acceptance

Only after the official cask is merged:

1. Change installation examples to `brew install --cask diri`.
2. Keep `cristicretu/homebrew-diri` available as a transition path rather than
   breaking existing installations immediately.
3. Update the release flow so official-cask updates follow Homebrew's supported
   contribution automation instead of pushing to the maintained tap directly.
4. Confirm `brew upgrade --cask diri` and Diri's in-app updater still agree on
   the latest version before closing the tracking issue.
